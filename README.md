Use at own risk :)

this is a very temp solution that will hopefully work for you till the SDK is released.

I compiled this in VS2022 community edition

If it complies copy all the output to a folder name ModTemplate in Kithack's Mod directory.

Launch the game, enable the mod in settings and restart.  Quit t5he game reloag in and the info debug show hello world
