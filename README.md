Use at own risk :)

this is a very temp solution that will hopefully work for you till the SDK is released.

I compiled this in VS2022 community edition

If it complies copy all the output to a folder name ModTemplate in Kithack's Mod directory.

Launch the game, enable the mod in settings and restart.  Quit the game reload and the info debug at the start of the game should say hello world
